# Image Processing and KNN Image Classification

## Overview
This project implements an advanced suite of image processing capabilities alongside a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) image classification system. It is designed to provide comprehensive tools for image manipulation and classification, leveraging Python's powerful libraries such as NumPy and PIL (Python Imaging Library). The project is structured to facilitate understanding and application of image processing techniques and KNN classification in a practical, hands-on manner.

## Features
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Perform various image manipulations including negation, grayscale, rotation, brightness adjustment, and blurring.
- **KNN Image Classification**: Classify images into different categories based on the closest training examples in the feature space.
- **PIL for Image Operations**: Use the Python Imaging Library for reading and writing images, and converting between PIL images and NumPy arrays for processing.
- **Extensive Documentation and Testing**: Comprehensive documentation and test cases ensure ease of use and reliability.

## Getting Started
